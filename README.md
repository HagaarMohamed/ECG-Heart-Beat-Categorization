# Adult Income Dataset: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the **Adult Income** dataset, with the goal of understanding the relationships between different demographic features and an individual's income level (whether they earn more or less than $50K annually).

## Dataset Overview

The **Adult Income** dataset is sourced from the 1994 U.S. Census Database and is widely used in data science and machine learning projects. The goal of this dataset is to predict whether a person earns more than $50K per year based on several features.


## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to perform an exploratory analysis to understand the structure of the dataset, visualize key relationships, and identify insights that may help in predicting income levels.

### Prerequisites

To run the project, the following Python libraries are required:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
